Monitor patients closely for adverse reactions and use clinical judgement when using BRAFTOVI with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors at the 150 mg dose level.

## 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS

Capsules: 75 mg, hard gelatin, stylized “A” on flesh opaque cap and “LGX 75mg” on white body.

## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS

None.

## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

### 5.1 New Primary Malignancies

New primary malignancies, cutaneous and noncutaneous, have been observed in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors and can occur with BRAFTOVI.

#### Cutaneous Malignancies

In COLUMBUS, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC), including keratoacanthoma (KA), occurred in 2.6%, and basal cell carcinoma occurred in 1.6% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. Median time to first occurrence of cuSCC/KA was 5.8 months (range 1 to 9 months) [see *Adverse Reactions* (6.1)].</a>

---

## Page 8

For patients who received BRAFTOVI as a single agent, cuSCC/KA was reported in 8%, basal cell carcinoma in 1%, and a new primary melanoma in 5% of patients.

In BEACON CRC, cuSCC/KA occurred in 1.4% of patients with CRC, and a new primary melanoma occurred in 1.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab.

In PHAROS, cuSCC and skin papilloma, each occurred in 2% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib.

In BREAKWATER, skin papilloma was reported in 2.6%, basal cell carcinoma in 1.3%, squamous cell carcinoma of skin in 0.9%, keratoacanthoma in 0.4% and malignant melanoma in situ in 0.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6.

Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiating treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of treatment. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Dose modification is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies.

## Noncutaneous Malignancies

Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor patients receiving BRAFTOVI for signs and symptoms of noncutaneous malignancies. Discontinue BRAFTOVI for RAS mutation-positive noncutaneous malignancies [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

## 5.2 Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors

In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells, which are exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation prior to initiating BRAFTOVI [see Indications and Usage (1), Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

## 5.3 Cardiomyopathy

Cardiomyopathy, manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction, has been reported in patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, evidence of cardiomyopathy (decreased in LVEF below the institutional LLN with an absolute decreased in LVEF ≥10% below baseline as detected by echocardiography or MUGA) occurred in 7% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib. Grade 3 left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1.6% of patients. The median time to first occurrence of left ventricular dysfunction (any grade) in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 3.6 months (range 0 to 21 months). Cardiomyopathy resolved in 87% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib.

In PHAROS, evidence of cardiomyopathy (decrease in LVEF below the institutional LLN with an absolute decrease in LVEF ≥10% below baseline as detected by echocardiography or MUGA) occurred in 11% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. Grade 3 left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1% of patients. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 82% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib.

Assess ejection fraction by echocardiogram or MUGA scan prior to initiating treatment, one month after initiating treatment, and every 2 to 3 months during treatment. The safety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib has not been established in patients with baseline ejection fraction that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN). Patients with cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored closely when treated with BRAFTOVI.

Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

# 5.4 Hepatotoxicity

Hepatotoxicity can occur when BRAFTOVI is administered in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 6% for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 2.6% for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and 0.5% for alkaline phosphatase. In PHAROS, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 10% for AST, 9% for ALT, and 3.2% for alkaline phosphatase.

In BREAKWATER, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 was 2.2% for alkaline phosphatase, 1.3% for ALT, and 0.9% for AST.

Monitor liver laboratory tests before initiation of BRAFTOVI, monthly during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

# 5.5 Hemorrhage

In COLUMBUS, hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; Grade 3 or greater hemorrhage occurred in 3.2% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were gastrointestinal, including rectal hemorrhage (4.2%), hematochezia (3.1%), and hemorrhoidal hemorrhage (1%). Fatal intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of new or progressive brain metastases occurred in 1.6% of patients.

In BEACON CRC, hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage occurred in 1.9% of patients, including fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 0.5% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were epistaxis (6.9%), hematochezia (2.3%), and rectal hemorrhage (2.3%).

In PHAROS, hemorrhage occurred in 12% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib including fatal hemorrhage intracranial (1%); Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 4.1% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were anal hemorrhage and hemothorax (2% each).

In BREAKWATER, hemorrhage occurred in 30% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6; Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients.

Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

# 5.6 Uveitis

Uveitis, including iritis and iridocyclitis, has been reported in patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, the incidence of uveitis among patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 4%. In PHAROS, the incidence of uveitis among patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 1%.

Assess for visual symptoms at each visit. Perform an ophthalmologic evaluation at regular intervals and for new or worsening visual disturbances, and to follow new or persistent ophthalmologic findings. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

# 5.7 QT Prolongation

BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation in some patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In COLUMBUS, an increase in QTcF to &gt;500 ms was measured in 0.5% (1/192) of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. In PHAROS, an increase in QTcF to &gt;500 ms was measured in 2.1% (2/95) of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib.

## Page 10

In BREAKWATER, an increase of QTcF &gt;500 ms was measured in 3.6% (8/222) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6.

Monitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure and those taking other medicinal products associated with QT prolongation. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to and during BRAFTOVI administration. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue for QTc &gt;500 ms [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

## 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Encorafenib produced embryo-fetal developmental changes in rats and rabbits and was an abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 26 (in the rat) and 178 (in the rabbit) times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 450 mg, with no clear findings at lower doses.

Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective, nonhormonal method of contraception since BRAFTOVI can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose of BRAFTOVI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

## 5.9 Risks Associated with BRAFTOVI as a Single Agent

BRAFTOVI when used as a single agent is associated with an increased risk of certain adverse reactions compared to when BRAFTOVI is used in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, Grades 3 or 4 dermatologic reactions occurred in 21% of patients treated with BRAFTOVI single agent compared to 2% of patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

If binimetinib is temporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued, reduce the dose of BRAFTOVI as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

## 5.10 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment

BRAFTOVI is indicated for use as part of a regimen in combination with binimetinib, in combination with cetuximab, or in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Refer to the prescribing information for binimetinib, cetuximab and individual product components of mFOLFOX6 for additional risk information.

# 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

# BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma

The safety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib is described in 192 patients with  $BRAF$  V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received BRAFTOVI (450 mg once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg twice daily) in a randomized open-label, active-controlled trial (COLUMBUS).

The COLUMBUS trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] excluded patients with a history of Gilbert's syndrome, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged QTc ( $&gt;480$  ms), uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion. The median duration of exposure was 11.8 months for patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib and 6.2 months for patients treated with vemurafenib.

The most common  $(\geq 25\%)$  adverse reactions in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and arthralgia.

Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of BRAFTOVI occurred in  $30\%$  of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were nausea  $(7\%)$ , vomiting  $(7\%)$ , and pyrexia  $(4\%)$ . Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of BRAFTOVI occurred in  $14\%$  of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were arthralgia  $(2\%)$ , fatigue  $(2\%)$ , and nausea  $(2\%)$ . Five percent  $(5\%)$  of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI; the most common were hemorrhage in  $2\%$  and headache in  $1\%$  of patients.

Table 5 and Table 6 present adverse drug reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, identified in COLUMBUS. The COLUMBUS trial was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib, as compared to vemurafenib, for any specific adverse reaction listed in Table 5.

The safety of BRAFTOVI  $300\mathrm{mg}$  once daily in combination with cetuximab  $(400\mathrm{mg / m}^2$  initial dose, followed by  $250\mathrm{mg / m}^2$  weekly) was evaluated in 216 patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic CRC in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial (BEACON CRC). The BEACON CRC trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] excluded patients with a history of Gilbert's syndrome, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged QTc  $(&gt;480~\mathrm{ms})$ , uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion. The median duration of exposure was 4.4 months for patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and 1.6 months for patients treated with either irinotecan or infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/folinic acid (FA)/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in combination with cetuximab.

The most common  $(\geq 25\%)$  adverse reactions in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, dermatitis acneiform, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, arthralgia, and rash.

Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of BRAFTOVI occurred in  $33\%$  of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; the most common were vomiting  $(4\%)$ , fatigue  $(4\%)$ , nausea  $(4\%)$ , pyrexia  $(3\%)$ , and diarrhea  $(3\%)$ . Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of BRAFTOVI occurred in  $9\%$  of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; the most common were fatigue  $(2\%)$ , arthralgia  $(2\%)$ , and peripheral neuropathy  $(2\%)$ . Ten percent  $(10\%)$  of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI. None of the adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI occurred in more than one patient  $(&gt;0.5\%)$ .

The safety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was evaluated in 98 patients with  $BRAF$  V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC who received BRAFTOVI (450 mg once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg twice daily) in an open-label, single-arm trial (PHAROS).

The PHAROS trial [see Clinical Studies (14.4)] excluded patients with abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged QTc ( $&gt;480$  ms), uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion. The median duration of treatment for BRAFTOVI and binimetinib was 9.2 and 8.4 months, respectively.

The most common  $(\geq 25\%)$  adverse reactions in patients receiving BRAFTOVI were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, visual impairment, constipation, dyspnea, rash, and cough.

Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of BRAFTOVI occurred in  $59\%$  of patients receiving BRAFTOVI; the most common  $(\geq 5\%)$  were diarrhea  $(17\%)$ ; nausea  $(13\%)$ ; musculoskeletal pain, fatigue  $(8\%$  each); AST increased  $(7\%)$ ; ALT increased, anemia, hemorrhage, vomiting  $(6\%$  each); and acute kidney injury  $(5\%)$ . Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of BRAFTOVI occurred in  $30\%$  of patients receiving BRAFTOVI; the most common  $(\geq 5\%)$  were diarrhea, nausea  $(8\%$  each); AST increased and fatigue  $(5\%$  each). A total of  $16\%$  of patients receiving BRAFTOVI experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI; the most common  $(\geq 2\%)$  were diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain  $(3.1\%$  each); fatigue, rash, nausea, visual impairment, and vomiting  $(2\%$  each). None of the other adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI occurred in more than 1 patient.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in  $38\%$  of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. Serious adverse reactions occurring in  $\geq 2\%$  of patients were hemorrhage  $(6\%)$ ; diarrhea  $(4.1\%)$ ; anemia, dyspnea, pneumonia  $(3.1\%$  each); arrhythmia, device related infection, edema, myocardial infarction, and pleural effusion  $(2\%$  each). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in  $2\%$  of patients who received BRAFTOVI  $(450\mathrm{mg}$  once daily) in combination with binimetinib, including intracranial hemorrhage and myocardial infarction  $(1\%$  each).

Table 11 and Table 12 present adverse drug reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, identified in PHAROS.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on BRAFTOVI

Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Coadministration of BRAFTOVI with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor increases encorafenib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] and may increase encorafenib adverse reactions. Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, including grapefruit juice. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the BRAFTOVI dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

^{}[] 20

Strong CYP3A4 Inducers

Coadministration of BRAFTOVI with a strong CYP3A4 inducer may decrease encorafenib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] and may decrease encorafenib efficacy. Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong CYP3A4 inducers.

7.2 Effect of BRAFTOVI on Other Drugs

Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates

BRAFTOVI is a strong CYP3A4 inducer at steady-state. Concomitant use of BRAFTOVI may decrease the plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (including hormonal contraceptives), [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. Avoid the coadministration of BRAFTOVI with CYP3A4 substrates for which a decrease in plasma concentration may lead to reduced efficacy of the substrate. If the coadministration cannot be avoided, see the CYP3A4 substrate product labeling for recommendations.

OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BCRP Substrates

Coadministration of BRAFTOVI with OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BCRP substrates can result in increased concentrations of the substrates, and may increase toxicity of these agents. When used in combination, monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of increased exposure and consider adjusting the dose of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval

BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with drugs known to prolong the QT/QTc interval.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no available clinical data on the use of BRAFTOVI during pregnancy. In animal reproduction studies, encorafenib produced embryo-fetal developmental changes in rats and rabbits and was an abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 26 (in the rat) and 178 (in the rabbit) times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 450 mg, with no clear findings at lower doses (see Data). Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

In reproductive toxicity studies, administration of encorafenib to rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, decreased fetal weights, and increased incidence of total skeletal variations at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 26 times the human exposure based on area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] at the recommended clinical dose of 450 mg once daily). In pregnant rabbits, administration of encorafenib during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, decreased fetal body weights, increased incidence of total skeletal variations and increased post-implantation loss, including total loss of pregnancy at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 178 times the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 450 mg once daily). While formal placental transfer studies have not been performed, encorafenib exposure in the fetal plasma of both rats and rabbits was up to 1.7% and 0.8%, respectively, of maternal exposure.

## 8.2 Lactation

### Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of encorafenib or its metabolites in human milk or the effects of encorafenib on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from BRAFTOVI, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the last dose.

## 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Pregnancy Testing

Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating BRAFTOVI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Contraception

#### Females

Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the last dose. Counsel patients to use a nonhormonal method of contraception since BRAFTOVI has the potential to render hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

#### Infertility

##### Males

Based on findings in male rats at doses approximately 13 times the human exposure at the 450 mg clinical dose, use of BRAFTOVI may impact fertility in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

## 8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of BRAFTOVI have not been established in pediatric patients.

## 8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 690 patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib across multiple clinical trials, 20% were aged 65 to 74 years and 8% were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Of the 231 patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic CRC who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6, 83 (36%) were 65 years of age and over and 16 (7%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Of the 216 patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic CRC who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab, 62 (29%) were 65 years of age to up to 75 years of age, while 20 (9%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Of the 98 patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC who received BRAFTOVI with binimetinib, 62 (63%) were 65 years of age and over and 20 (20%) were 75 years and over [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

No overall differences in the safety or effectiveness of BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib, BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab, or BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 were observed in older patients as compared to younger patients.

# 8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No BRAFTOVI dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A recommended dosage has not been established in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.

# 8.7 Renal Impairment

No BRAFTOVI dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to  $&lt; 90~\mathrm{mL / min}$ ) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A recommended dosage has not been established in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr  $&lt; 30~\mathrm{mL / min}$ ).

# 10 OVERDOSAGE

Since encorafenib is  $86\%$  bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is likely to be ineffective in the treatment of overdose with BRAFTOVI.

# 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

# 12.1 Mechanism of Action

Encorafenib is a kinase inhibitor that targets  $BRAF$  V600E, as well as wild-type BRAF and CRAF in in vitro cell-free assays with  $\mathrm{IC}_{50}$  values of 0.35, 0.47, and  $0.3\mathrm{nM}$ , respectively. Mutations in the BRAF gene, such as  $BRAF$  V600E, can result in constitutively activated BRAF kinases that may stimulate tumor cell growth. Encorafenib was also able to bind to other kinases in vitro including JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, LIMK1, LIMK2, MEK4, and STK36 and reduce ligand binding to these kinases at clinically achievable concentrations ( $\leq 0.9~\mu \mathrm{M}$ ).

Encorafenib inhibited in vitro growth of tumor cell lines expressing  $BRAF$  V600 E, D, and K mutations. In mice implanted with tumor cells expressing  $BRAF$  V600E, encorafenib induced tumor regressions associated with RAF/MEK/ERK pathway suppression.

## Page 24

Encorafenib and binimetinib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Compared with either drug alone, coadministration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity in vitro in BRAF mutation-positive cell lines and greater anti-tumor activity with respect to tumor growth inhibition in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenograft studies in mice. Additionally, the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib delayed the emergence of resistance in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in mice compared to either drug alone. In a BRAF V600E mutant NSCLC patient-derived xenograft model in mice, coadministration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-tumor activity compared to binimetinib alone, with respect to tumor growth inhibition. Increased tumor growth delay after dosing cessation was also observed with the coadministration compared to either drug alone.

In the setting of BRAF-mutant CRC, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway activation has been identified as a mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Combinations of a BRAF inhibitor and agents targeting EGFR have been shown to overcome this resistance mechanism in nonclinical models.

Coadministration of encorafenib and cetuximab had an anti-tumor effect greater than either drug alone, in a mouse model of colorectal cancer with mutated BRAF V600E.

## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics

### Cardiac Electrophysiology

A dedicated study to evaluate the QT prolongation potential of BRAFTOVI has not been conducted. BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation. Based on a central tendency analysis of QTc in a study of adult patients with melanoma who received the recommended dose of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib, the largest mean (90% CI) QTcF change from baseline (ΔQTcF) was 18 (14 to 22) ms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of encorafenib were studied in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumors, including advanced and unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma harboring a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic CRC. After a single dose, systemic exposure of encorafenib was dose proportional over the dose range of 50 mg to 700 mg (0.1 to 1.6 times the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg). After once-daily dosing, systemic exposure of encorafenib was less than dose proportional over the dose range of 50 mg to 800 mg (0.1 to 1.8 times the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg). Steady-state was reached within 15 days, with exposure being 50% lower compared to Day 1; intersubject variability (CV%) of AUC ranged from 12% to 69%.

### Absorption

The median T_max of encorafenib is 2 hours. At least 86% of the dose is absorbed.

### Effect of Food

Following administration of a single dose of BRAFTOVI 100 mg (0.2 times the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg) with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (consisting of approximately 150 calories from protein, 350 calories from carbohydrates, and 500 calories from fat) the mean maximum encorafenib concentration (C_max) decreased by 36% and there was no effect on AUC.

### Distribution

The geometric mean (CV%) of apparent volume of distribution is 164 L (70%). The protein binding of encorafenib is 86% in vitro. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.58.

### Elimination

The mean (CV%) terminal half-life (t₁/₂) of encorafenib is 3.5 hours (17%), and the apparent clearance is 14 L/h (54%) at day 1, increasing to 32 L/h (59%) at steady-state at the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg.

# Metabolism

Encorafenib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 (83%) and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 (16%) and CYP2D6 (1%).

# Excretion

Following a single radiolabeled dose of 100 mg encorafenib, 47% (5% unchanged) of the administered dose was recovered in feces and 47% (2% unchanged) in urine.

# Specific Populations

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib were observed based on age (19 to 94 years), sex, body weight (34 to 168 kg), mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), and mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to &lt;90 mL/min). The effect of race or ethnicity, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), and severe renal impairment (CLcr &lt;30 mL/min) on encorafenib pharmacokinetics have not been studied.

# Drug Interaction Studies

## Clinical Studies

**CYP3A4 Inhibitors**: Coadministration of posaconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) or diltiazem (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased AUC of encorafenib by 3- and 2-fold, respectively, and increased Cmax by 68% and 45%, respectively, after a single dose of 50 mg BRAFTOVI (0.1 times the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg).

**Strong CYP3A4 Inducers**: The effect of a strong CYP3A4 inducer on encorafenib exposure has not been studied [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

**Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers**: Repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with modafinil, a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, decreased encorafenib steady-state AUC by 24% and Cmax by 20%, compared to BRAFTOVI alone.

**Effect of encorafenib on CYP3A4 Substrates**: Repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with a single dose of midazolam 2 mg, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, decreased midazolam AUC by 82% and Cmax by 74% relative to midazolam 2 mg alone.

**Effect of encorafenib on Other CYP Substrates**: There was no clinically significant effect of repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily on the exposure of substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.

**Proton Pump Inhibitors**: No clinically significant differences in encorafenib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with rabeprazole.

**Binimetinib**: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of binimetinib (UGT1A1 substrate) were observed when coadministered with BRAFTOVI (UGT1A1 inhibitor).

**Cetuximab**: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib or cetuximab were observed when the recommended BRAFTOVI dose of 300 mg was coadministered with cetuximab.

**Transporters**: Repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with a single dose of rosuvastatin (a sensitive substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BCRP) increased rosuvastatin Cmax by 2.7-fold and AUC by 1.6-fold.

# In Vitro Studies

**CYP/UGT Enzymes**: Encorafenib is a reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1.

**Transporters**: Encorafenib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) but not of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) or organic cation transporter (OCT1) at clinically relevant plasma concentrations.

Encorafenib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OCT2, organic anion transporter (OAT1, OAT3), OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not of OCT1 or MRP2 at clinically relevant plasma concentrations.

## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

### 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenicity studies with encorafenib have not been conducted. Encorafenib was not genotoxic in studies evaluating reverse mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells, or micronuclei in bone marrow of rats.

No dedicated fertility studies were performed with encorafenib in animals. In a general toxicology study in rats, decreased testes and epididymis weights, tubular degeneration in testes, and oligospermia in epididymides were observed at doses approximately 13 times the human exposure at the 450 mg clinical dose based on AUC. No effects on reproductive organs were observed in either sex in any of the nonhuman primate toxicity studies.

### 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology

Adverse histopathology findings of hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis occurred in the stomach of rats at encorafenib doses of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 14 times the human exposure at the 450 mg clinical dose based on AUC) or greater, in both 4 and 13-week studies.

## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES

### 14.1 BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma

BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial (COLUMBUS; NCT01909453). Eligible patients were required to have BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, as detected using the bioMerieux THxID™ BRAF assay. Patients were permitted to have received immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting and one prior line of immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. Prior use of BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors was prohibited. Randomization was stratified by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage (IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a or IVM1b, versus IVM1c), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 versus 1), and prior immunotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease (yes versus no).

Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily in combination with binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib), BRAFTOVI 300 mg once daily, or vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Only the results of the approved dosing (BRAFTOVI 450 mg in combination with binimetinib 45 mg) are described below.

The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by a blinded independent central review, to compare BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib with vemurafenib. Additional efficacy outcome measures included overall survival (OS), as well as objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) which were assessed by central review.

A total of 577 patients were randomized, 192 to the BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib arm, 194 to the BRAFTOVI arm, and 191 to the vemurafenib arm. Of the 383 patients randomized to either the BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib or the vemurafenib arms, the median age was 56 years (20 to 89 years), 59% were male, 91% were White, and 72% had baseline ECOG performance status of 0. Ninety-five percent (95%) had metastatic disease, 65% were Stage IVM1c, and 4% received prior CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 directed antibodies. Twenty-eight percent (28%) had elevated baseline serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 45% had ≥3 organs with tumor involvement at baseline, and 3% had brain metastases. Based on centralized testing, 100% of patients' tumors tested positive for BRAF mutations; BRAF V600E (88%), BRAF V600K (11%), or both (&lt;1%).

# 14.2 BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)-BRAFTOVI with Cetuximab and mFOLFOX6

BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 was evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial (BREAKWATER CRC; NCT04607421). Eligible patients were required to have BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), as detected using the Qiagen therascreen BRAF V600E RGQ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Kit. Other key eligibility criteria included no prior systemic treatment in the metastatic setting, absence of prior treatment with any selective BRAF inhibitor or EGFR inhibitor, tumor that is not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) unless the patient is ineligible to receive immune checkpoint inhibitors, tumor that is not RAS-mutated or for which RAS mutation status is unknown, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1. Randomization was stratified by ECOG performance status (0 versus 1) and region (US/Canada versus Europe versus Rest of World).

Patients were initially randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following treatment arms, and then 1:1 after discontinuation of enrollment of the BRAFTOVI+cetuximab arm (158 patients):

and capecitabine  $1000\mathrm{mg / m^2}$  oral tablet twice daily on Days 1-14; FOLFOXIRI consisted of irinotecan  $165\mathrm{mg / m^2}$ , oxaliplatin  $85\mathrm{mg / m^2}$ , leucovorin  $400\mathrm{mg / m^2}$ , 5-FU 2400 or  $3200\mathrm{mg / m^2}$  (per local standard of care) continuous IV infusion over 46-48 hours.

Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or death. Only the results of the approved regimen (BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6) are described below.

The major efficacy outcome measure was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by BICR and was evaluated in the first 110 participants randomized in each arm. An additional efficacy outcome measure included duration of response (DoR) as assessed by BICR.

A total of 236 patients were randomized to the BRAFTOVI+cetuximab+mFOLFOX6 arm and 243 to the control arm. Of these patients, the median age was 61 years,  $50\%$  were female,  $60\%$  were White,  $37\%$  were Asian,  $0.4\%$  were Multiracial,  $0.2\%$  were Black or African American, and  $2.5\%$  were not reported. Twelve percent  $(12\%)$  were Hispanic or Latino,  $81\%$  were not Hispanic or Latino, and  $7\%$  were not reported. Fifty-four percent  $(54\%)$  had baseline ECOG performance status of 0.

BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in ORR compared to the active comparator. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 14 below.

# 14.3 BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRC)

BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab was evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial (BEACON CRC; NCT02928224). Eligible patients were required to have  $BRAF$  V600E mutation-positive metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), as detected using the Qiagen therascreen  $BRAF$  V600E RGQ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Kit, with disease progression after 1 or 2 prior regimens. Other key eligibility criteria included absence of prior treatment with a RAF, MEK, or EGFR inhibitor, eligibility to receive cetuximab per local labeling with respect to tumor RAS status, and ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1. Randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 versus 1), prior use of irinotecan (yes versus no), and cetuximab product used (US-licensed versus EU-approved).

Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following treatment arms:

---

## Page 30

- BRAFTOVI  $300\mathrm{mg}$  orally once daily in combination with cetuximab (BRAFTOVI/cetuximab arm)
- BRAFTOVI  $300\mathrm{mg}$  orally once daily in combination with binimetinib and cetuximab
- Irinotecan with cetuximab or FOLFIRI with cetuximab (control arm)

The dosage of cetuximab in all patients was  $400\mathrm{mg / m^2}$  intravenously for the first dose followed by  $250\mathrm{mg / m^2}$  weekly.

Patients in the control arm received cetuximab with either irinotecan  $180\mathrm{mg / m^2}$  intravenously on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle or FOLFIRI intravenously (irinotecan  $180\mathrm{mg / m^2}$  on Days 1 and 15; folinic acid  $400\mathrm{mg / m^2}$  on Days 1 and 15; then fluorouracil  $400\mathrm{mg / m^2}$  bolus on Days 1 and 15 followed by fluorouracil  $2400\mathrm{mg / m^2}$ /day by continuous infusion over 2 days).

Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Only the results of the approved regimen (BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab) are described below.

The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Additional efficacy outcome measures included progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DoR) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). OS and PFS were assessed in all randomized patients. ORR and DoR were assessed in the subset of the first 220 patients included in the randomized portion of the BRAFTOVI/cetuximab and control arm of the study.

A total of 220 patients were randomized to the BRAFTOVI/cetuximab arm and 221 to the control arm. Of these 441 patients, the median age was 61 years;  $53\%$  were female;  $80\%$  were White,  $15\%$  were Asian, and  $5\%$  were other or not reported. Four percent  $(4\%)$  were Hispanic or Latino,  $90\%$  were not Hispanic or Latino, and  $6\%$  were not reported or unknown. Fifty percent  $(50\%)$  had baseline ECOG performance status of 0;  $66\%$  received 1 prior therapy and  $34\%$  received 2;  $93\%$  received prior oxaliplatin and  $52\%$  received prior irinotecan.

BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS, ORR, and PFS compared to the active comparator. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 15 and Figure 2.

# 14.4 BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 

BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was evaluated in an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study in patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (PHAROS; NCT03915951). Eligible patients had a diagnosis of histologically-confirmed metastatic NSCLC with BRAF $V 600 E$ mutation that was treatment-naïve or had been previously treated with 1 prior line of systemic therapy in the metastatic setting (platinum-based chemotherapy and/or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies), age 18 years or older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 , and measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Prior use of BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors was not allowed.
Patients received BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and duration of response (DoR) as assessed by independent review committee (IRC).
In the efficacy population, BRAF V600E mutation status was determined by prospective local testing using tumor tissue ( $78 \%$ ) or blood ( $22 \%$ ) specimens. Of the 98 patients with BRAF V600E mutation, 6 patients were enrolled into the trial based on testing of their tumor tissue specimens with the FoundationOne CDx tissue test. Of the remaining 92 patients enrolled based on local testing, 68 patients had their tumor tissue specimens retrospectively confirmed as having BRAF V600E positive status by the FoundationOne CDx tissue test. The remaining patients had either BRAF V600E negative status $(\mathrm{n}=5)$ or had unevaluable results $(\mathrm{n}=19)$ by the FoundationOne CDx tissue test. In addition, plasma samples from 81 out of 98 patients were retrospectively tested using the FoundationOne Liquid CDx assay. Of the 81 patients, 48 were confirmed positive for BRAF $V 600 E$, while 33 patients were BRAF V600E mutation negative by FoundationOne Liquid CDx assay. The remaining 17 samples had unevaluable results with FoundationOne Liquid CDx assay.
The efficacy population included 59 treatment-naïve patients and 39 previously-treated patients. Among these 98 patients, the median age was 70 years (range: 47 to 86); $53 \%$ female; $88 \%$ White, $7 \%$ Asian, $3 \%$ Black or African American, and 1\% American Indian or Alaska Native; 99\% were not Hispanic or Latino; 13\% were

current smokers and $57 \%$ were former smokers; $73 \%$ had ECOG PS of 1 ; and $97 \%$ had adenocarcinoma. All patients had metastatic disease, and $8 \%$ had brain metastases at baseline.
Efficacy results for patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC are summarized in Table 16.

## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).
Inform patients of the following:

## New Primary Malignancies

Advise patients that BRAFTOVI increases the risk of developing new primary cutaneous and noncutaneous malignancies. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately for change in or development of new skin lesions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

## Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors

Advise patients of the need to confirm BRAF V600E or V600K mutation prior to initiating BRAFTOVI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

## Cardiomyopathy

Advise patients to report any symptoms of heart failure to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

## Hepatotoxicity

Advise patients that serial testing of serum liver tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin) is recommended during treatment with BRAFTOVI. Instruct patients to report symptoms of liver dysfunction including jaundice, dark urine, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, bruising, or bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

## Hemorrhage

---

## Page 34

Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider immediately with any symptoms suggestive of hemorrhage, such as unusual bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

# Uveitis 

Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience any changes in their vision [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

## QT Prolongation

Advise patients that BRAFTOVI can cause QTc interval prolongation and to inform their physician if they have any QTc interval prolongation symptoms, such as syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

## Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

- Advise females with reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, during treatment with BRAFTOVI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
- Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective nonhormonal contraception during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the last dose [Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].


## Lactation

Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

## Infertility

Advise males of reproductive potential that BRAFTOVI may impair fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

## Drug Interactions

Coadministration of BRAFTOVI with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor may increase encorafenib concentrations; coadministration of BRAFTOVI with a strong CYP3A inducer may decrease encorafenib concentrations. Advise patients that they may need to avoid certain medications while taking BRAFTOVI and to inform their healthcare provider of all concomitant medications, including prescription medicines, over-thecounter drugs, vitamins, and herbal products. Advise patients to avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while taking BRAFTOVI [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

# MEDICATION GUIDE 

BRAFTOVI ${ }^{\circledR}$ (braf-TOE-vee)
(encorafenib)
capsules
Important information: BRAFTOVI is used in combination with other medicines, including binimetinib, cetuximab, or cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin). Read the Medication Guide that comes with binimetinib if BRAFTOVI is used with binimetinib. Talk to your healthcare provider about cetuximab, or cetuximab and mFOLFOX 6 if used with BRAFTOVI.

## What is the most important information I should know about BRAFTOVI?

## BRAFTOVI may cause serious side effects, including:

Risk of new skin cancers. BRAFTOVI when used alone, or with binimetinib or cetuximab, may cause skin cancers called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma.
Talk to your healthcare provider about your risk for these cancers.
Check your skin and tell your healthcare provider right away about any skin changes, including a:
new wart
skin sore or reddish bump that bleeds or does not heal
change in size or color of a mole
Your healthcare provider should check your skin before treatment with BRAFTOVI, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months after you stop treatment with BRAFTOVI to look for any new skin cancers.
Your healthcare provider should also check for cancers that may not occur on the skin. Tell your healthcare provider about any new symptoms that develop during treatment with BRAFTOVI.
See "What are the possible side effects of BRAFTOVI?" for more information about side effects.

## What is BRAFTOVI?

BRAFTOVI is a prescription medicine used:

- in combination with a medicine called binimetinib to treat people with a type of skin cancer called melanoma:
- that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery, and
- that has a certain type of abnormal "BRAF" gene
- in combination with a medicine called cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) to treat people with cancer of the colon or rectum (colorectal cancer):
- that has spread to other parts of the body, and
- that has a certain type of abnormal "BRAF" gene
- in combination with a medicine called cetuximab to treat adults with cancer of the colon or rectum (colorectal cancer) after past treatment:
