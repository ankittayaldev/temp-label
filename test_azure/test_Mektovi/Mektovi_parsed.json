There are no available clinical data on the use of MEKTOVI during pregnancy. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of binimetinib during the period of organogenesis was embryotoxic and an abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 5 times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 45 mg twice daily (see Data). Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is $2 \\%$ to $4 \\%$ and $15 \\%$ to $20 \\%$, respectively.\n\n## Data\n\n## Animal Data\n\nIn reproductive toxicity studies, administration of binimetinib to rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, decreased fetal weights and increased variations in ossification at doses $\\geq 30 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{kg} /$ day (approximately 37 times the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 45 mg twice daily). In pregnant rabbits, administration of binimetinib during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, decreased fetal body weights, an increase in malformations, and increased post-implantation loss, including total loss of pregnancy at doses $\\geq 10 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{kg} /$ day (approximately 5 times the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 45 mg twice daily). There was a significant increase in fetal ventricular septal defects and pulmonary trunk alterations at $20 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{kg} /$ day of binimetinib (less than 8 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 45 mg twice daily).\n\n### 8.2 Lactation\n\n## Risk Summary\n\nThere are no data on the presence of binimetinib or its active metabolite in human milk, or the effects of binimetinib on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with MEKTOVI and for 3 days after the last dose.\n\n### 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\n\nBased on animal data, MEKTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\n\n## Pregnancy Testing\n\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating MEKTOVI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\n\n## Contraception\n\nFemales",

Dose adjustment for MEKTOVI is not recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin $>1$ and $\\leq 1.5 \\times$ ULN and any AST or total bilirubin $\\leq$ ULN and AST $>$ ULN). Reduce the dose of MEKTOVI for patients with moderate (total bilirubin $>1.5$ and $\\leq 3 \\times$ ULN and any AST) or severe (total bilirubin levels $>3 \\times$ ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\n\nSince binimetinib is $97 \\%$ bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is likely to be ineffective in the treatment of overdose with MEKTOVI.\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\n\nBinimetinib is a kinase inhibitor. The chemical name is 5-[(4-bromo-2-fluorophenyl)amino]-4-fluoro-N-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazole-6-carboxamide. The molecular formula is $\\mathrm{C}_{17} \\mathrm{H}_{15} \\mathrm{BrF}_{2} \\mathrm{~N}_{4} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$ and the molecular weight is 441.2 daltons. The chemical structure of binimetinib is shown below:\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nBinimetinib is a white to slightly yellow powder. In aqueous media, binimetinib is slightly soluble at pH 1 , very slightly soluble at pH 2 , and practically insoluble at pH 4.5 and higher.\nMEKTOVI (binimetinib) tablets for oral use contain 15 mg of binimetinib with the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate (vegetable origin), and silica colloidal anhydrous. The film-coating contains polyvinyl alcohol, macrogol, titanium dioxide, talc, iron oxide yellow, and iron oxide black.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n\n### 12.1 Mechanism of Action\n\nBinimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activity. MEK proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. In vitro, binimetinib inhibited extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in cell-",

Binimetinib also inhibited in vivo ERK phosphorylation and tumor growth in BRAF-mutant murine xenograft models.\n\nBinimetinib and encorafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Compared to either drug alone, coadministration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity in vitro in BRAF mutation-positive cell lines and greater anti-tumor activity with respect to tumor growth inhibition in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenograft studies in mice. Additionally, the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib delayed the emergence of resistance in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in mice compared to either drug alone. In a BRAF V600E mutant NSCLC patient-derived xenograft model in mice, coadministration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-tumor activity compared to binimetinib alone, with respect to tumor growth inhibition. Increased tumor growth delay after dosing cessation was also observed with the coadministration compared to either drug alone.\n\n# 12.2 Pharmacodynamics \n\n## Cardiac Electrophysiology\n\nFollowing MEKTOVI 45 mg twice daily, no clinically meaningful QT prolongation was observed.\n\n### 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of binimetinib was studied in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumors. After twice-daily dosing, the accumulation is 1.5 -fold and the coefficient of variation ( $\\mathrm{CV} \\%$ ) of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) is $<40 \\%$ at steady state. The systemic exposure of binimetinib is approximately dose proportional.\n\n## Absorption\n\nAfter oral administration, at least $50 \\%$ of the binimetinib dose was absorbed with a median time to maximum concentration $\\left(\\mathrm{T}_{\\max }\\right)$ of 1.6 hours.\n\n## Effect of Food\n\nThe administration of a single dose of MEKTOVI 45 mg with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (consisting of approximately 150 calories from protein, 350 calories from carbohydrate, and 500 calories from fat) in healthy subjects had no effect on binimetinib exposure.\n\n## Distribution\n\nBinimetinib is $97 \\%$ bound to human plasma proteins and the blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.72 . The geometric mean ( $\\mathrm{CV} \\%$ ) of apparent volume of distribution of binimetinib is $92 \\mathrm{~L}(45 \\%)$.\n\n## Elimination\n\nThe mean ( $\\mathrm{CV} \\%$ ) terminal half-life $\\left(\\mathrm{t}_{1 / 2}\\right)$ of binimetinib is 3.5 hours ( $28.5 \\%$ ) and apparent clearance (CL/F) is $20.2 \\mathrm{~L} / \\mathrm{h}(24 \\%)$.\n\n## Metabolism\n\nThe primary metabolic pathway is glucuronidation with UGT1A1 contributing up to $61 \\%$ of the binimetinib metabolism. Other pathways of binimetinib metabolism include N -dealkylation, amide hydrolysis, and loss of ethane-diol from the side chain. The active metabolite M3 produced by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 represents $8.6 \\%$ of the binimetinib exposure. Following a single oral dose of 45 mg radiolabeled binimetinib, approximately $60 \\%$ of the circulating radioactivity AUC in plasma was attributable to binimetinib.\n\n## Excretion\n\nFollowing a single oral dose of 45 mg radiolabeled binimetinib in healthy subjects, $62 \\%$ ( $32 \\%$ unchanged) of the administered dose was recovered in the feces while $31 \\%$ ( $6.5 \\%$ unchanged) was recovered in the urine.\n\n## Specific Populations",

      "markdown": "Age (20 to 94 years), sex, or body weight do not have a clinically important effect on the systemic exposure of binimetinib. The effect of race or ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of binimetinib is unknown.\nHepatic Impairment: No clinically meaningful changes in binimetinib exposure (AUC and $\\mathrm{C}_{\\max }$ ) were observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin $>1$ and $\\leq 1.5 \\times$ ULN and any AST or total bilirubin $\\leq$ ULN and AST $>$ ULN) as compared to subjects with normal liver function (total bilirubin $\\leq$ ULN and AST $\\leq$ ULN). A 2-fold increase in AUC was observed in subjects with moderate (total bilirubin $>1.5$ and $\\leq 3 \\times$ ULN and any AST) or severe (total bilirubin levels $>3 \\times$ ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\nRenal Impairment: In subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR $\\leq 29 \\mathrm{~mL} / \\mathrm{min} / 1.73 \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$ ), no clinically important changes in binimetinib exposure were observed as compared to subjects with normal renal function.\n\n# Drug Interaction Studies \n\n## Clinical Studies\n\nEffect of UGT1A1 Inducers or Inhibitors on Binimetinib: UGT1A1 genotype and smoking (UGT1A1 inducer) do not have a clinically important effect on binimetinib exposure. Simulations predict similar $\\mathrm{C}_{\\max }$ of binimetinib 45 mg in the presence or absence of atazanavir 400 mg (UGT1A1 inhibitor).\nNo differences in binimetinib exposure have been observed when MEKTOVI is coadministered with encorafenib.\nEffect of Binimetinib on CYP Substrates: Binimetinib did not alter the exposure of a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate (midazolam).\nEffect of Acid Reducing Agents on Binimetinib: The extent of binimetinib exposure (AUC) was not altered in the presence of a gastric acid reducing agent (rabeprazole).\n\n## In Vitro Studies\n\nEffect of Binimetinib on CYP Substrates: Binimetinib is not a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or CYP3A.\nEffect of Transporters on Binimetinib: Binimetinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Binimetinib is not a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1) or organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1).\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n\n### 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n\nCarcinogenicity studies with binimetinib have not been conducted. Binimetinib was not genotoxic in studies evaluating reverse mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells, or micronuclei in bone marrow of rats.\n\nNo dedicated fertility studies have been conducted with binimetinib in animals. In general toxicology studies in rats and monkeys, there were no remarkable findings in male or female reproductive organs.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n\n### 14.1 BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma\n\nMEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib was evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial (COLUMBUS; NCT01909453). Eligible patients were required to have BRAF V600E or $V 600 K$ mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, as detected using the bioMerieux THxID ${ }^{\\mathrm{TM}}$ BRAF assay. Patients were permitted to have received immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting and one prior line of immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. Prior use of BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors was prohibited. Randomization was stratified by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage (IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a or IVM1b, versus IVM1c), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ( 0 versus 1 ), and prior immunotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease (yes versus no).",

Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Only the results of the approved dosing (MEKTOVI 45 mg in combination with encorafenib 450 mg ) are described below.\n\nThe major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by a blinded independent central review, to compare MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib with vemurafenib.

Eligible patients had a diagnosis of histologically-confirmed metastatic NSCLC with BRAF V600E mutation that was treatment-naïve or had been previously treated with 1 prior line of systemic therapy in the metastatic setting (platinum-based chemotherapy and/or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies), age 18 years or older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 , and measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Prior use of BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors was not allowed.\nPatients received MEKTOVI 45 mg orally twice daily and encorafenib 450 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and duration of response (DoR) as assessed by independent review committee (IRC).\nIn the efficacy population, BRAF V600E mutation status was determined by prospective local testing using tumor tissue ( $78 \\%$ ) or blood ( $22 \\%$ ) specimens. Of the 98 patients with BRAF V600E mutation, 6 patients were enrolled into the trial based on testing of their tumor tissue specimens with the FoundationOne CDx tissue test. Of the remaining 92 patients enrolled based on local testing, 68 patients had their tumor tissue specimens retrospectively confirmed as having BRAF V600E positive status by the FoundationOne CDx tissue test. The remaining patients had either BRAF V600E negative status ( $\\mathrm{n}=5$ ) or had unevaluable results $(\\mathrm{n}=19)$ by the FoundationOne CDx tissue test. In addition, plasma samples from 81 out of 98 patients were retrospectively tested using the FoundationOne Liquid CDx assay. Of the 81 patients, 48 were confirmed positive for BRAF V600E, while 33 patients were BRAF V600E mutation negative by FoundationOne Liquid CDx assay. The remaining 17 samples had unevaluable results with FoundationOne Liquid CDx assay.\nThe efficacy population included 59 treatment-naïve patients and 39 previously-treated patients. Among these 98 patients, the median age was 70 years (range: 47 to 86); $53 \\%$ female; $88 \\%$ White, $7 \\%$ Asian, $3 \\%$ Black or African American, and 1\\% American Indian or Alaska Native; 99\\% were not Hispanic or Latino; $13 \\%$ were current smokers and $57 \\%$ were former smokers; $73 \\%$ had ECOG PS of 1 ; and $97 \\%$ had adenocarcinoma. All patients had metastatic disease and $8 \\%$ had brain metastases at baseline.",
